<h1>design choices for Andrew's thought processing language</h1>
<h2>background/introduction</h2>

For a language that can be mutated, should Andrew go with a text-based language or with a block-based language.  To help address this, the following initial example was generated.
<p/>
Initial example:  Given a distance to a goal from a starting point, traverse in the opposite direction the same distance diff the current target attribute value with the past value, and forcast a linear relationship.

<h2>possible approaches</h2>

<h3>code-based representation of initial example</h3>
forcastValue = (2 * Node($startNode).getNumberAttr($targetAttr)) - (traverse($startNode, $relname, $direction, $distance).getNumberAttr($targetAttr))

<h3>block-based representation of initial example</h3>

<h2>conclusions</h2>
Given a choice of representation, choice was made to be a code-block based language over an ANTLR type language.
